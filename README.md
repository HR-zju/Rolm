Radar SLAM: yeti radar odometry + ScanContext-based Loop Closing 

## What is Navtech-Radar-SLAM? 
- In this repository, a (minimal) SLAM problem is defeind as **SLAM = Odometry + Loop closing**, and the optimized states are only robot poses along a trajectory.  
- Based on the above view, this repository aims to integrate current available radar odometry, radar place recognition, and pose-graph optimization. 
    1. Radar odometry: [Yeti open source](https://github.com/keenan-burnett/yeti_radar_odometry) that implemented cen2018 and cen2019 methods with considering motion distortation for RANSAC.
        - The odometry modules consumes file-based input (not ROS subscription) in this example. See `odometry/yeti_radar_odometry/src/odometry.cpp` for the details. 
        - However, to seamlessly connect the motion estimation result with the later place recognition module, we added ROS publishing lines to [the original odometry.cpp code](https://github.com/keenan-burnett/yeti_radar_odometry/blob/master/src/odometry.cpp). Also, see `odometry/yeti_radar_odometry/src/odometry.cpp` for the details. 
    2. Radar place recognition: [Scan Context open source](https://github.com/irapkaist/scancontext)
        - In MulRan dataset paper, the radar scan context is also proposed, but in this repository we use a Cartesian 2D feature point cloud (extracted via cen2019 method) as an input for the original Scan Context (IROS2018) method and it works. 
        - The Scan Context-based loop detection is included in the file `pgo/SC-A-LOAM/laserPosegraphOptimization.cpp`.
    3. Pose-graph optimization
        - iSAM2 in GTSAM is used. See `pgo/SC-A-LOAM/laserPosegraphOptimization.cpp` for the details (ps. the implementation is eqaul to [SC-A-LOAM](https://github.com/gisbi-kim/SC-A-LOAM) and it means `laserPosegraphOptimization.cpp` node is generic!)

## How to use? 

### Dependencies 
- Yeti: OpenCV and SC-PGO: GTSAM 

### Steps 
First, clone and build.
```
$ mkdir -p ~/catkin_radarslam/src && cd ~/catkin_radarslam/src
$ git clone https://github.com/gisbi-kim/navtech-radar-slam.git && cd ..
$ catkin_make 
```
Second, 
- [Download a sequence from the MulRan dataset](https://sites.google.com/view/mulran-pr/download) (you need to download polar_oxford_form.zip) 
- Change [this line in the yeti launch](https://github.com/gisbi-kim/navtech-radar-slam/blob/2921851c0735894d38998ca1a2057af2e8abbfd9/odometry/yeti_radar_odometry/launch/yeti_radar_odometry.launch#L4) to your downloaded and unzipped radar data directory path. 

Then, enjoy!
```
$ source devel/setup.bash
$ roslaunch src/navtech-radar-slam/launch/navtech_radar_slam_mulran.launch
```
## Examples 
- The examples are from [MulRan dataset](https://sites.google.com/view/mulran-pr/home), which is suitable to evaluate the radar odometry or SLAM algorithm in complex urban sites. 
    - The MulRan dataset provides the oxford-radar-robotcar-radar data format (i.e., meta data such as ray-wise timestamps are imbedded in an radar image, [see details here](https://oxford-robotics-institute.github.io/radar-robotcar-dataset/documentation#radar))

## TODO
- About utilities 
    - support ROS-based input (topic subscription)
    - support a resulting map save functions.  
- About performances 
    - support reverse loop closing.
    - enhance RS (radius-search) loop closings.
